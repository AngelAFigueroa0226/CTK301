		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img class="floatimage" src="Birdhouse.jpg" alt="Birhouse Placeholder">
		<p>My name is Angel Figueroa. Currently, I am a student studying Game Design at Illinois State University. I hope to be able to make something that I can be proud of in the future. </p>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>I originally wanted to be a game developer after playing the game called 'Little Big Planet' which fostered my creativity during my childhood. Although, most likely due to my age, I was hesitant to delve into the level creating side of the game; when I did, however, I didn't make much due to the fact that I was holding myself to other people's standards.</p>
		<p>I started my history with game design and development around my time in high school. I practiced with the program RPG maker in creating small scale projects to practice. Although most of those projects are almost entirely lost, the practice I gained was very useful when I started my game design classes in senior year of high school. Since entering college, my opportunities in practing development have only grown due to studying the subject even further.</p>
