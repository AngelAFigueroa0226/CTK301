		<h3>Space Pirates DND</h3>
		<img class="floatimage" src="SpacePirates.png" alt="Planet Picture">
		<p>This is the current final project for my Game Design 1 class. We were tasked with creating a game that embodies 'high mechanics' and 'high context'. After some deliberation, and hearing the ideas of others within my class, I came to the decision to work on an RPG module set within a sci-fi setting about pirates on an alien oceanic planet. I have been working as the main writer for the project, whilst my partner works on the gameplay side of the project due to his previous experience with DND in the past, using 5th edition as a base for our rules.</p>
		<p>Currently, by my estimate, there is around 4 hours of gameplay current written for, although that could easily be expanded as the module is played. It has been a learning experience having to write a module, since you have to try and prepare for every possible choice that the party of characters could make. Writing the characters themselves, since the nature of the project prevents a session 0, was fun and it was interesting to see the players' interpretations of them during playtests.</p>
